# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project applies Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.

## Dataset
- Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
- Features: 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of breast mass

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC

## Results
The model demonstrates strong classification performance on the WDBC dataset, confirming the effectiveness of Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
